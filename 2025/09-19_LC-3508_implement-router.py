    LC 3508. Implement Router

    Goal
    ----
    Design a router that stores up to `memoryLimit` packets and supports:
      - addPacket(source, destination, timestamp) -> bool
      - forwardPacket() -> [source, destination, timestamp] or []
      - getCount(destination, startTime, endTime) -> int
    with queries for addPacket coming in non-decreasing timestamp order.

    Data structures
    ---------------
    - q:     deque of packets in arrival order (FIFO): (src, dst, ts).
             This is the ground truth for the buffer content & eviction order.
    - seen:  set of (src, dst, ts) to reject duplicates in O(1).
    - ts:    destination -> list of timestamps (append-only, non-decreasing).
             We never physically delete timestamps; instead we advance a start
             pointer. This keeps getCount fast via binary search.
    - start: destination -> first valid index in ts[dest] (i.e., how many oldest
             timestamps for that destination have been evicted/forwarded).

    Rationale
    ---------
    * addPacket:
        - O(1) amortized for push + O(1) duplicate check.
        - If full, evict oldest from q in O(1); mark as removed by bumping
          start[dst] (lazy deletion) so ts arrays remain sorted and contiguous.
    * forwardPacket:
        - Pop from q in O(1) and bump start[dst]. Also remove from `seen`.
    * getCount:
        - Use bisect over ts[dst] with lo=start[dst] to ignore old entries:
          O(log K), where K is current #timestamps tracked for that destination.

    Complexity
    ----------
    - addPacket / forwardPacket: O(1) amortized
    - getCount: O(log K) per query
    - Space: O(N) for at most 1e5 operations (bounded by problem constraints)
