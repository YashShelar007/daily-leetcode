    LC 2353. Design a Food Rating System

    Approach: per-cuisine max-heap with lazy deletion
      - Keep current truth in two dicts:
          food2cuisine[food] -> cuisine
          food2rating[food]  -> rating
      - For each cuisine, maintain a heap of (-rating, name).
        We *never* remove old entries on update; instead, we push a fresh
        pair and discard stale tops when answering highestRated.

    Tie-break: Python compares tuple elements leftâ†’right, so (-rating, name)
    ensures higher rating first; for equal ratings, lexicographically smaller
    name wins.

    Complexity:
      - changeRating:  O(log k) where k = #items of that cuisine
      - highestRated:  Amortized O(log k) due to lazy pops
      - Space:         O(n) for heaps + maps
