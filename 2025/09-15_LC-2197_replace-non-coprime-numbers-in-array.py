        LC 2197. Replace Non-Coprime Numbers in Array

        Idea (stack):
          - Iterate left to right, maintain a stack of the finalized prefix.
          - For each x:
              while stack not empty and gcd(stack[-1], x) > 1:
                  x = lcm(stack[-1], x); pop()
              push x
          - This works because any new LCM may now combine with the previous top, so
            we keep merging backward until the top is coprime with x.

        Why this beats pop/insert-in-place:
          - Avoids O(n) middle operations repeatedly â†’ linear-time passes with small
            constant gcd cost.

        Time Complexity:  O(n * T_gcd) (amortized; each element pushed/popped a few times)
        Space Complexity: O(n) for the stack
