        Idea:
          - Find 'affected' users (endpoints of friendships with no shared language).
          - Among affected users, count how many already know each language.
          - Teach the language that covers the most affected users.
            Answer = len(affected) - max_covered.

        Time Complexity:  O(m + sum(len(l[u])) over affected)  (â‰¤ ~5e5 here)
        Space Complexity: O(n + m)
