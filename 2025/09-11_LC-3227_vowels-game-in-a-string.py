        LC 3227. Vowels Game in a String

        Game:
          - Alice removes any non-empty substring with an ODD number of vowels.
          - Bob removes any non-empty substring with an EVEN number of vowels.
          - Alice moves first; optimal play; last mover wins.

        Observation:
          - If the string has no vowels, Alice has no legal move â‡’ she loses.
          - If the string has at least one vowel, Alice can remove a 1-length
            vowel substring (odd=1), guaranteeing at least one move and, under
            optimal play, a win for this impartial take-turns setup.

        Therefore: Alice wins iff s contains at least one vowel.

        Space Complexity: O(1)
